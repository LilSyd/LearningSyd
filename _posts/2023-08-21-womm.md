title: What's on my mind right now
---

It's almost the end of August and it's been quite a busy summer for me. 

I've been having a lot of creative ideas recently and that's actually why I'm writing this article today.

My plans for the upcoming months are still very blurry but autumn and back to school season are really motivating to me. My mindset is a lot different from this summer and it feels good, like I'm "back on track" in a way. 

I've also been super into knitting again and I found 3 projects I want to get started on as soon as I finish the 2 projects I currently have goign on (a knitted dress and scarf).

Right now I'm planning to spend a nice day out tomorrow in Paris and enjoying all the Japanese things I miss the most. 

How's your week looking like ?
