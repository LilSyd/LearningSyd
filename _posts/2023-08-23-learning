title: What about learning ?
---
I'm very passionate about learning. I always have been and probably always will be. 

I used to love going to school, I was super excited to advance grades when I was younger and I loved going to university because it meant I could manage my own time.

But after graduating from my Master's Degree in the height of the pandemic it was really hard for me to continue learning. It was pretty obvious to me that I would keep leanring when I started working in a company, but finding work at that time was difficult (to say the least) and I figured out other ways to learn by myself. 

I discovered a free online course titled "Learning how to learn" (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">here on coursera</a>) and at first I thought this would have been so helpful to me in my studying years, but it also motivated me to keep learning even more on my own, because I had more tools to try now.
I highly recommend that course to anyone interested in learning tools, or just curious to know more about it.

On another note, I've spent a lot of time thinking about what learning means to me, it's a very simple term used very regularly but to me it's also a state of mind. I think everything gives a learning opportunity, from the littlest upset to huge life projects. It doesn't matter when or how it happens, there's always something to learn. 
By now it's something I've managed to do instinctively but I always like to ask myself "What can I learn from this?".

A few tips : 
<li>Learning more about subjects we already know about gives it a freshness</li>
<li>Learning is way more fun when you take breaks</li>
<li>Learning is a personal journey so figure out what suits you best and go for it</li>
