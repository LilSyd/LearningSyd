Hi, I'm Sydney ! I love learning new things, food and manual crafts.

This blog is my place to write about learning and my view on learning as a lifelong occupation and mindset.

On this blog you'll find : 
- Reviews of classes and courses
- Learning tips about my interests
- Posts where I share my mindset around learning

This blog is for those interested about learning as a mindset and the challenges that come with it. 

Don't hesitate to send me questions or recommendations you have and want me to write about. 

Hope you enjoy it !
