Hello, I'm Sydney ! 

I've always wanted to write and post articles online but was too scared to do it.
So this website is where I'll be sharing what I write regulary. 

I love learning new things, food and manual crafts.

This blog is for those interested to follow my adventure.

Feel free to reach out to me ! 

Hope you enjoy it !
